# PCPNet: Learning Local Shape Properties from Point Cloud Patches
**This is an old and unmaintained repository - for the updated code see http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2018/pcpnet/**

For now, it is a pure lua/torch implementation of 
[Deep Learning for Robust Normal Estimation in Unstructured Point Clouds](https://sites.google.com/view/boulch/publications/2016_cgf_sgp_deepnormals?authuser=0).
It is based on the C++ code provided by [Alexandre Boulch](https://sites.google.com/view/boulch/home?authuser=0).
